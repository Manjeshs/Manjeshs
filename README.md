### 3. Music Rhythm Circuit
- **Description:** The circuit uses a microphone to pick up sound and convert it to a voltage signal. This signal passes through a filter and is amplified by a transistor. The amplified signal then causes multiple transistors and LEDs to turn on and off according to the beats and pitch of the music.
